**TLDR**

We should work to formalize machine learning research with Homotopy Type Theory.

---


## Type Theory

Type Theory is an alternative

---

## Homotopy Type Theory

Homotopy Type Theory is created by adding the "univalence axiom" to standard type theory. This can be loosely stated as "equivalence is equivalent to equality". A useful if informal description of what this means

This an incredibly rich (and difficult) area of research under active development so I will not attempt to explain the concept myself but I would direct you to .. if you are interested.

There are 2 important things about __Homotopy Type Theory__:

- It can be used as an alternative foundation of Mathematics.
- It has a computational interpretation (Cubical Type Theory)

I am personally a very big fan of static types and powerful type systems, with Haskell normally being viewed as the "gold standard" for that. 





## Category Theory

Category Theory has been slowly creeping up in popularity, being used in more areas of research from Quantum Computing to System design (according to NASA). I have recently been exposed to it and believe that while many of it's concepts can feel alien and unnecessarily abstract, it is very valuable.



You may say, that was an incredibly long winded way of saying that we should use types in our Machine Learning research code (which I would love for people do also), however the point I hope to get across is that there is a sort of "canonical" way which we can formalize some of our machine learning research that would actually be practically useful.
