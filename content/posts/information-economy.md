We are living in an "Information Economy", this is something someone has doubtlessly said to you at some point. It is true, however I feel like many of the people who go around saying this don't fully realise to the extent which it is true.


When most of us think of the phrase we think, Google, Facebook, Apple and the rest of "Big Tech". Incredibly large tech comglomerates who have managed to gain control of many important facets of our life, to what we see, who we communicate with and what we find.

Many of the CEOs who claim they run "data driven" organisations think they are the ones on the forefront of the __Information Enconomy__, but they are missing the forest amoung the trees. It is true that with the advent of the internet and modern computers, it is much easier to calculate and observe analytics and data which can enable superior business decisisons then could be made without them but to think of this as what the extent of the era we are approaching is foolish and short sighted.

Big Tech Companies have made it seem like a pretty standard business approach to provide a loss leading service for free, to use this to obtain data and then turn around and make a profit from this collected data. This makes some citizens deeply uncomfortable, their data is being monoitsed and they have limited control over what is done with it.

Putting any moral objections aside to this practice (and there are many), it seems ... odd from a business point of view. This way of operating limits entry to many industries to those with the upfront capital to be able to produce such a loss leading product. And this is having a compounding effect, big tech companies are getting bigger, they are aquiring smaller (but stiil very substaintail) companies for the purpose of getting access to specific data. Data of all types is being bought and sold, which gives us an incredilbly obvious conclusion that these companies expect to be able to profit from these transactions. They believe that the cost they are paying for it, will be worth the amount of value they can extract from it. This is like any other resource that is used in our economy.

This poses some interesting questions however

### Do we wish to have data being bought and sold?

While it is easy to simply say that data shouldn't be able to be sold, this is not infact a solution to the informatin economy. A person who through their work in a company is dealing with you data, and through that dealing is able to learn to be more efficent at their work haas extracted value from this data. And the company which employess them is then in turn able to extract value from the employee. It is not the data itself which is valuable, it is the information which can be inferred from it which is. And the proliferation of new information, approaches, techniques etc is how economies grow. This has always happened, what has changed is the scale and speed of this information extraction.


### Why is information valuable?

Why are all of these companies so keen to obtain this data, and protective of it once they have? It is because what it enables them to do is immensly profitable, sell more impactful ads, predict global events etc.

We are always talking about these massive corporations, why about the little guy? This is one of the main issues with our current information economoy. The little guy can't get access to same kind of information. They lack the scale at which to be able to collect it, to be able to make inference from it.

Some might refer to this in standard economic terms as "economies of scale" and that is unfortuneatly just how it is. The large players can entrench their positions by virtue of their scale. Some might say that this is inevitable and to just accept it.

If this information was easier to access (you might say more liquid), would the econony not prosper? Is this not what we want?

### Who owns this data?

This data which these companies are selling to each other, who owns it? If we are going to embraise the idea of the information economoy this is something which needs to be settled. I can't sell something which I don't own, but information is tricky.

Information can be duplicated at next to no cost, so by giving someone else access to it you have not necessarily lost anything but they can gain value. So giving access to someone can have positive value to them. So you would be justified in wishing to be componsated for this access.


### Homomorphic encryption and differential privacy

Homo-morphic encryption is when it is possible to perform operations on encrypted data. Differentail privacy is an approach which is used to quantify how much information about one individual can be obtained by performing some operation.

This leads to an interesting idea, payment for access to data denomonated by the amount of information actually gained. Lets say bits.

The general idea is as follows, you as an individual have decieded that some data which you have access to may be informative to others. 

- Lets say your daily health data

- I am a researcher attempted to collect statistics on weight of indiduals correlated with some other factor and I think that your data would be quite useful.
- You have set the amount at which you value your weight information, lets say at 8 shannons, also lets say that your weight measurement contains is 8 bits.
- I wish to run some calculations on the data, which would enable 1 bit of information to be given to me.
- I would then pay you 1 shannon in exchange for this access.

After this transaction, you have gained some unit of currency which you believe is fair. And I have gained some information which I can use.

The use of homomorphic encryption and differentail privacy ensures that your data has not and can't be copied by me to resell to someone else.

This transaction has effectively given me full permissions over this single bit, it is now my data in my possetion. I can perhaps use the data whcih I have collected and the information which I have extracted and sell this to a additional party for more than I paid for it.

Or

We could design our system as chains or processing and data, and that you retain some rights over the profits made from your data. So we could agree that post processing that if I make 6 shannons from my data on the network you would be given 1 of these, every time I am paid you are paid. This is a superset of the previous as we can just set a 0 proportion deal.



Through the system we could enforce limits on the number of bits of information which you give to any individual party. However this does not preclude the possibility that a number of parties could attempt to cooperate to obtain more information from you than you are comfortable giving them. A possible solution to this is that secondary transactions are also all of this system. 




Options:
Limit the amount of information which can be removed from this network, for the network to be useful at all we require that information can be extracted from it.
