AWS Spot Instances are a way of getting computing resources at a steep discount. The reason they are much cheaper than a standard instance is that if there is high demand the price may change and if it rises above you max price the instance may be terminated, not a stable situation for a production server but perfect for small scale machine learning experiments.

First go to your AWS dashboard.
Then click on the EC2 under Compute.

Go to launch instance

Then select the Ubuntu 14.04 image

Pick whichever spec machine you want.
<strong>If you want to use Keras for Deep Learning I would strongly recommend selecting an instance at this stage that contains a GPU</strong>

Tick the spot instance button and put in a relatively high number(It doesn't matter you won't be paying this price)
Click Review and Launch

Click Launch

Make sure to download the key pair or else you wont be able to access the instance.

Success!

You now have an AWS instance that is started.
Now go to your running instances and take note of your public IP

Next install putty and puttygen from [here](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

Open Puttygen and load in the key that you downloaded.

Then save the private key, close puttygen and open putty.

In the hostname field type ubuntu@(your ip)
<img src="http://www.johnryan.tech/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screenshot-4.png" alt="" />

Navigate to Connection -&gt; SSH -&gt; Auth and set the private to key to the one created by Puttygen

Go back to session and enter a name in "Saved Sessions" then click save, in the future you can just select the name you have given it and select load to open the SSH session.

Click open, then click yes on the security alert.

When the shell appears enter the following commands to install sklearn on the instance

## Installing Scikit-Learn
`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get upgrade`

`sudo apt-get -y install python-numpy`

`sudo apt-get -y install python-scipy`

`sudo apt-get -y install python-pip`

`sudo pip install scikit-learn`

That's it! You now have setup an AWS spot instance with scikit-learn installed.
## Installing Keras
We are going to be using the Theano back-end for Keras in this tutorial.

First we will install Theano

`sudo apt-get install python-nose g++ libopenblas-dev git`

`sudo pip install Theano`

Then we will install CUDA for GPU acceleration.

`sudo wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1404/x86_64/cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_7.0-28_amd64.deb`

`sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_7.0-28_amd64.deb`

`sudo apt-get update`

`apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname â€“r)`

`sudo apt-get install -y cuda`

`echo -e "\nexport PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH\n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64" >> .bashrc`

`echo -e "\n[global]\nfloatX=float32\ndevice=gpu0\n[mode]=FAST_RUN\n\n[nvcc]\nfastmath=True\n\n[cuda]\nroot=/usr/local/cuda" >> ~/.theanorc`

`sudo reboot`

Then reconnect and install keras

`sudo pip install keras`
