Definition (From wikipedia)
A time continuous schochastic process $ \left{ X_t ; t \in T \right} $ is Gaussian iff for every finite set of indices $t_1,\ldots ,t_k \in T$
$$X_{t_1,\ldots, t_k} = \left(X_{t_1} , \ldots, X_{t_k} \right)$$
is a multivariate Gaussian.</description><dc:creator>John Ryan</dc:creator><category>machine learning</category></item><item><title>Induction for the Leaving Cert</title><link>https://johnryan.tech/posts/induction-lc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 14:07:33 +0000</pubDate><author>johnryan465@gmail.com (John Ryan)</author><atom:modified>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 14:07:33 +0000</atom:modified><guid>https://johnryan.tech/posts/induction-lc/</guid><description>This is going to be possibly the first in a series of posts primarily aimed at for leaving cert students who are currently missing out on school due to COVID-19 but still have exams.
These will be aimed at helping you to understand a concept so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to rely on rote learning (I always found that quite difficult personally)
Proof by Induction Proofs are core to maths and are a reasonably reliable part of the Leaving Cert Maths papers.</description><dc:creator>John Ryan</dc:creator><category>leaving cert</category></item></channel></rss>
